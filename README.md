# Random Password Generator

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to build a random password generator.

## User Story
AS AN employee with access to sensitive data  
I WANT to randomly generate a password that meets certain criteria  
SO THAT I can create a strong password that provides greater security

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN I need a new, secure password  
* WHEN I click the button to generate a password, THEN I am presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.  
* WHEN prompted for password criteria, THEN I select which criteria to include in the password.  
* WHEN prompted for the length of the password, THEN I choose a length of at least 8 characters and no more than 128 characters.  
* WHEN asked for character types to include in the password, THEN I confirm whether or not to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or special characters.  
* WHEN I answer each prompt, THEN my input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.  
* WHEN all prompts are answered, THEN a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.  
* WHEN the password is generated, THEN the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
